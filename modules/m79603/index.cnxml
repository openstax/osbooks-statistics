<para id="eip-123456789"><term>Box plots</term>, also called <term>box-and-whisker plots</term> or <term>box-whisker plots</term>, give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. They also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. As mentioned previously, a box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them.</para><para id="element-175">To construct a box plot, use a horizontal or vertical number line and a rectangular box. The smallest and largest data values label the endpoints of the axis. The first quartile marks one end of the box, and the third quartile marks the other end of the box. Approximately <emphasis>the middle 50 percent of the data fall inside the box.</emphasis> The <emphasis effect="italics">whiskers</emphasis> extend from the ends of the box to the smallest and largest data values. A box plot easily shows the range of a data set, which is the difference between the largest and smallest data values (or the difference between the maximum and minimum). Unless the median, first quartile, and third quartile are the same value, the median will lie inside the box or between the first and third quartiles. The box plot gives a good, quick picture of the data.</para>

<item>Answers will vary. Possible answer: State University conducted a survey to see how involved its students are in community service. The box plot shows the number of community service hours logged by participants over the past year.</item>
<item>Because the first and second quartiles are close, the data in this quarter is very similar. There is not much variation in the values. The data in the third quarter is much more variable, or spread out. This is clear because the second quartile is so far away from the third quartile.</item>
