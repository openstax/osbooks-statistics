<title>Chapter Objectives</title>
  <para id="element-667">By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</para>
<list id="list67">
  <item>Differentiate between Type I and Type II errors</item>
<item>Describe hypothesis testing in general and in practice</item>
<item>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation known</item>
<item>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation unknown</item>
<item>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population proportion</item></list>
  </note>

<para id="eip-123456789">One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population. <term>Confidence intervals</term> are one way to estimate a population parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to make a decision about a parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets 35 miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90 percent of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $60,000 per year.</para>
    <para id="element-818">A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called <term>hypothesis testing.</term> A hypothesis test involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then, the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis.</para><para id="element-224">In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions.
    You will also learn about the errors associated with these tests. </para>
  <para id="element-616">Hypothesis testing consists of two contradictory hypotheses or statements, a decision based on the data, and a conclusion. To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will do the following:
<list id="list-1" list-type="enumerated"><item>Set up two contradictory hypotheses.</item>
<item>Collect sample data. In homework problems, the data or summary statistics will be given to you.</item>
<item>Determine the correct distribution to perform the hypothesis test.</item>
<item>Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow you to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis.</item>
<item>Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion.</item>
</list>
