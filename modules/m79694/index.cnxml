<para id="eip-511">We could guess at outliers by looking at a graph of the scatter plot and best-fit line. However, we would like some guideline regarding how far away a point needs to be to be considered an outlier. <emphasis effect="italics">As a rough rule of thumb, we can flag as an outlier any point that is located farther than two standard deviations above or below the best-fit line</emphasis>.

With regard to the TI-83, 83+, or 84+ calculators, the graphical approach is easier. The graphical procedure is shown first, followed by the numerical calculations.

In context, the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept indicates that when there are no returning sparrow hawks, there will be almost 32 percent new sparrow hawks, which doesn’t make sense, because if there are no returning birds, then the new percentage would have to be 100% (this is an example of why we do not extrapolate).

<para id="fs-idp137409168">e. The ordered pair (66, 6) generates the largest residual of 6.0.

If we remove this data pair, we see only an adjusted slope of 0.2789 and an adjusted intercept of 30.9816.

<item>We have a slope of –1.4946 with a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept of 193.88. The slope, in context, indicates that for each additional minute added to the swim time, the heart rate decreases by 1.5 beats per minute. If the student is not swimming at all, the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept indicates that his heart rate will be 193.88 beats per minute. Although the slope has meaning (the longer it takes to swim 2000 m, the less effort the heart puts out), the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept does not make sense. If the athlete is not swimming (resting), then his heart rate should be very low.</item>
<item>Because only 1.5 percent of the heart rate variation is explained by this regression equation, we must conclude that this association is not explained with a linear relationship.</item>
<item>Point (34.72, 124) generates the largest residual: –11.82. This means that our observed heart rate is almost 12 beats less than our predicted rate of 136 beats per minute. When this point is removed, the slope becomes 2.953, with the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept changing to 247.1616. Although the linear association is still very weak, we see that the removed data pair can be considered an influential point in the sense that the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept becomes more meaningful.</item>
