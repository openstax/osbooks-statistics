<para id="fs-idm39235328">Establishing the type of distribution, sample size, and known or unknown standard deviation can help you figure out how to go about a hypothesis test. However, there are several other factors you should consider when working out a hypothesis test.</para>

<title>Rare Events</title>
<!--<para id="fs-idp23331840">Suppose you make an assumption about a property of the population (this assumption is the <term>null hypothesis</term>). Then you gather sample data randomly. If the sample has properties that would be very <emphasis>unlikely</emphasis> to occur if the assumption is true, then you would conclude that your assumption about the population is probably incorrect. (Remember that your assumption is just an <term>assumption</term>&#8212;it is not a fact and it may or may not be true. But your sample data are real and the data are showing you a fact that seems to contradict your assumption.)</para>-->
<para id="fs-id1164566489530">The thinking process in hypothesis testing can be summarized as follows: You want to test whether or not a particular property of the population is true. You make an assumption about the true population mean for numerical data or the true population proportion for categorical data. This assumption is the null hypothesis. Then you gather sample data that is representative of the population. From this sample data you compute the sample mean (or the sample proportion). If the value that you observe is very unlikely to occur (a rare event) if the null hypothesis is true, then you wonder why this is happening. A plausible explanation is that the null hypothesis is false.</para><para id="element-969">For example, Didi and Ali are at a birthday party of a very wealthy friend. They hurry to be first in line to grab a prize from a tall basket that they cannot see inside because they will be blindfolded. There are 200 plastic bubbles in the basket, and Didi and Ali have been told that there is only one with a $100 bill. Didi is the first person to reach into the basket and pull out a bubble. Her bubble contains a $100 bill. The probability of this happening is <m:math><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>200</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:math> = 0.005. Because this is so unlikely, Ali is hoping that what the two of them were told is wrong and there are more $100 bills in the basket. A <emphasis effect="italics">rare event</emphasis> has occurred (Didi getting the $100 bill) so Ali doubts the assumption about only one $100 bill being in the basket.</para>
