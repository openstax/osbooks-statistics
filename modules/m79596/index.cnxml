<para id="fs-idm26748320">Does aspirin reduce the risk of heart attacks? Is one brand of fertilizer more effective at growing roses than another? Is fatigue as dangerous to a driver as speeding? Questions like these are answered using randomized experiments. In this module, you will learn important aspects of experimental design. Proper study design ensures the production of reliable, accurate data.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164568065305">The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. In an experiment, there is the <emphasis effect="bold">explanatory variable</emphasis> which affects the <emphasis effect="bold">response variable</emphasis>. In a randomized experiment, the researcher manipulates the explanatory variable and then observes the response variable. Each value of the explanatory variable used in an experiment is called a <emphasis effect="bold">treatment</emphasis>.</para><para id="fs-idp20958864">You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a group of subjects and ask them if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E exhibit better health on average than those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease prevention? It does not. There are many differences between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet, other vitamin supplements. Any one of these factors could be influencing health. As described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention.</para><para id="fs-idm26816896">Additional variables that can cloud a study are called <term>lurking variables</term>. In order to prove that the explanatory variable is causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The researcher must design her experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being compared: the planned treatments. This is accomplished by the <term>random assignment</term> of experimental units to treatment groups. When subjects are assigned treatments randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the groups. At this point the only difference between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must be a direct result of the different treatments. In this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between the explanatory and response variables.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164567483970">Confounding occurs when the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated, for instance, if a student guesses on the even-numbered questions on an exam and sits in a favorite spot on exam day. Why does the student get a high test scores on the exam? It could be the increased study time or sitting in the favorite spot or both.  Confounding makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor on the outcome. The way around this is to test several outcomes with one method (treatment). This way, we know which treatment really works.</para><para id="fs-idm40990544">The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment. Studies have shown that the expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication. In one study of performance-enhancing substances, researchers noted the following:</para>
<para id="eip-753"><emphasis effect="italics">Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [</emphasis>performance<emphasis effect="italics">] times almost as fast as those associated with consuming the substance itself. In contrast, taking the substance without knowledge yielded no significant performance increment.</emphasis><footnote id="eip-idp13447456">McClung, M. and Collins, D. (2007 June). "Because I know it will!" Placebo effects of an ergogenic aid on athletic performance. <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology, 29(3), 382-94</emphasis>.</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-idp21694240">When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside one treatment group as a <term>control group</term>. This group is given a <term>placebo</term> treatment, a treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps researchers balance the effects of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are participating in a study and you know that you are receiving a pill that contains no actual medication, then the power of suggestion is no longer a factor. <term>Blinding</term> in a randomized experiment designed to reduce bias by hiding information. When a person involved in a research study is blinded, he does not know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving the placebo treatment. A <term>double-blind experiment</term> is one in which both the subjects and the researchers involved with the subjects are blinded.</para><para id="fs-id1170309538048">Sometimes, it is neither possible nor ethical for researchers to conduct experimental studies. For example, if you want to investigate whether malnutrition affects elementary school performance in children, it would not be appropriate to assign an experimental group to be malnourished. In these cases, <term>observational studies</term> or <term>surveys</term> may be used. In an observational study, the researcher does not directly manipulate the independent variable. Instead, he or she takes recordings and measurements of naturally occurring phenomena. By sorting these data into control and experimental conditions, the relationship between the dependent and independent variables can be drawn. In a survey, a researchers measurements consist of questionnaires that are answered by the research participants.</para>

Some say that “numbers don’t lie,” but the people who use numbers to support their claims often do.</para><para id="fs-idp63161552">A recent investigation of famous social psychologist, Diederik Stapel, has led to the retraction of his articles from some of the world’s top journals including, <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Social Psychology, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, British Journal of Social Psychology,</emphasis> and the magazine <emphasis effect="italics">Science</emphasis>. Diederik Stapel is a former professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. Over the past two years, an extensive investigation involving three universities where Stapel has worked concluded that the psychologist is guilty of fraud on a colossal scale. Falsified data taints over 55 papers he authored and 10 Ph.D. dissertations that he supervised.</para><para id="eip-idm40688480"><emphasis effect="italics">Stapel did not deny that his deceit was driven by ambition. But it was more complicated than that, he told me. He insisted that he loved social psychology but had been frustrated by the messiness of experimental data, which rarely led to clear conclusions. His lifelong obsession with elegance and order, he said, led him to concoct results that journals found attractive. “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty—instead of the truth,” he said. He described his behavior as an addiction that drove him to carry out acts of increasingly daring fraud</emphasis>.<footnote id="fs-idp108571952">

<para id="fs-idp31763600">Clearly, it is never acceptable to falsify data the way this researcher did. Sometimes, however, violations of ethics are not as easy to spot.</para>




<para id="fs-idp40590784">Researchers have a responsibility to verify that proper methods are being followed. The report describing the investigation of Stapel’s fraud states that, “statistical flaws frequently revealed a lack of familiarity with elementary statistics.”<footnote id="eip-idp26097968">Tillburg University.

Unfortunately, they did not know very much about statistical analysis, and they simply trusted that he was collecting and reporting data properly.</para><para id="fs-idp112502080">Many types of statistical fraud are difficult to spot. Some researchers simply stop collecting data once they have just enough to prove what they had hoped to prove. They don’t want to take the chance that a more extensive study would complicate their lives by producing data contradicting their hypothesis.</para>




<para id="fs-idp75599696">Professional organizations, like the American Statistical Association, clearly define expectations for researchers. There are even laws in the federal code about the use of research data.</para>




<para id="fs-idp35202800">When a statistical study uses human participants, as in medical studies, both ethics and the law dictate that researchers should be mindful of the safety of their research subjects. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services oversees federal regulations of research studies with the aim of protecting participants. When a university or other research institution engages in research, it must ensure the safety of all human subjects. For this reason, research institutions establish oversight committees known as <term>Institutional Review Boards (IRB)</term>. All planned studies must be approved in advance by the IRB. Key protections that are mandated by law include the following:</para><list id="fs-idp105688032" list-type="bulleted"><item>Risks to participants must be minimized and reasonable with respect to projected benefits.</item>
<item>Participants must give <term>informed consent</term>. This means that the risks of participation must be clearly explained to the subjects of the study. Subjects must consent in writing, and researchers are required to keep documentation of their consent.</item>
<item>Data collected from individuals must be guarded carefully to protect their privacy.</item>
</list><para id="fs-idm5212816">These ideas may seem fundamental, but they can be very difficult to verify in practice. Is removing a participant’s name from the data record sufficient to protect privacy? Perhaps the person’s identity could be discovered from the data that remains. What happens if the study does not proceed as planned and risks arise that were not anticipated? When is informed consent really necessary? Suppose your doctor wants a blood sample to check your cholesterol level. Once the sample has been tested, you expect the lab to dispose of the remaining blood. At that point the blood becomes biological waste. Does a researcher have the right to take it for use in a study?</para><para id="fs-idp36402832">It is important that students of statistics take time to consider the ethical questions that arise in statistical studies. How prevalent is fraud in statistical studies? You might be surprised—and disappointed. There is a <link window="new" url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/40introone">website</link> dedicated to cataloging retractions of study articles that have been proven fraudulent.

<para id="eip-idp9699152">The graphs do not show scales of values. We do not know the period of time each graph represents; they may show data from different years. We also do not know if the vertical scales on each graph are equivalent. The scales may have been adjusted to exaggerate or minimize trends. There is no reliable information to be gleaned from these graphs, and setting them up as examples of performance is misleading.</para>
