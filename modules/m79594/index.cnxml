<para id="id7862377">Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like <m:math>
<m:mi>x</m:mi>
</m:math> or <m:math>
<m:mi>y</m:mi>
</m:math> generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:</para><list id="id10607985" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Qualitative</item>
<item>Quantitative</item>
</list>
<para id="id9602938"><term id="term-00001">Qualitative data</term> are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called <term id="term-00002">categorical data</term>. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O–, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.</para>
<para id="id3365343"><term id="term-00003">Quantitative data</term> are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of <emphasis>counting</emphasis> or <emphasis>measuring</emphasis> attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either <term id="term-00004">discrete</term> or <term id="term-00005">continuous</term>.</para><para id="id9750754">All data that are the result of counting are called <term id="term-00006">quantitative discrete data</term>. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three.</para>
<para id="id5023881">Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called <term id="term-00007">quantitative continuous data</term>. Continuous data are often  the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.</para>

<section id="eip-312"><title>Qualitative Data Discussion</title><para id="eip-298">Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College enrolled for the spring 2010 quarter. The tables display counts, frequencies, and percentages or proportions, relative frequencies. For instance, to calculate the percentage of part time students at De Anza College, divide 9,200/22,496 to get .4089. Round to the nearest thousandth—third decimal place and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is 40.9 percent.</para><para id="fs-id1164563494537">So, the percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College.</para>

<para id="fs-id1170308283619">This is a two-way table because it displays information about two categorical variables, in this case, gender and sports. Data of this type (two variable data) are referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">bivariate data</emphasis>. Because the data represent a count, or tally, of choices, it is a two-way <emphasis effect="italics">frequency</emphasis> table. The entries in the total row and the total column represent marginal frequencies or <emphasis effect="italics">marginal distributions</emphasis>. Note—The term marginal distributions gets its name from the fact that the distributions are found in the margins of frequency distribution tables. Marginal distributions may be given as a fraction or decimal: For example, the total for men could be given as .6 or 3/5 since <m:math display="block">

 </m:mrow>
</m:math> Marginal distributions require bivariate data and only focus on <emphasis effect="italics">one</emphasis> of the variables represented in the table. In other words, the reason 20 is a marginal frequency in this two-way table is because it represents the margin or portion of the total population that is women (20/50). The reason 25 is a marginal frequency is because it represents the portion of those sampled who favor football (25/50). Note: The values that make up the body of the table (e.g., 20, 8, 2) are called <emphasis effect="italics">joint frequencies</emphasis>.</para></section>

<para id="id12361474">Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. <emphasis>A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.</emphasis> Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods. There are several different methods of <emphasis>random sampling</emphasis>. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a <emphasis>simple random sample</emphasis>. In a simple random sample, each group has the same chance of being selected. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected. For example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number, as in <link target-id="element-621" document=""/>.</para><table id="element-621" summary="This table presents a class roster arranged in alphabetical order.

<para id="fs-id1164562246344">To choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then the sample is selected by picking the same number of values from each strata until the desired sample size is reached. For example, you could stratify (group) your high school student population by year (freshmen, sophomore, juniors, and seniors) and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each year) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each year, number each student of the first year, number each student of the second year, and do the same for the remaining years. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers of students from the first year and do the same for each of the remaining years. Those numbers picked from the first year, picked from the second year, and so on represent the students who make up the stratified sample.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164566895148">To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters.  All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four homeroom classes from your student population, the four classes make up the cluster sample. Each class is a cluster. Number each cluster, and then choose four different numbers using random sampling. All the students of the four classes with those numbers are the cluster sample. So, unlike a stratified example, a cluster sample may not contain an equal number of randomly chosen students from each class.</para>

<para id="id12385449">A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. <emphasis>Convenience sampling</emphasis> involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.</para><para id="id10814456">Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased. They may favor a certain group. It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.</para><para id="id11715554">When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of <emphasis>sampling errors</emphasis> and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause <emphasis>nonsampling errors</emphasis>. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.</para>
<para id="fs-idp101680848">In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error.  As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.</para>
<para id="fs-idp40043264">In statistics, <emphasis>a sampling bias</emphasis> is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others. Remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen.  When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied. For instance, if a survey of all students is conducted only during noon lunchtime hours is biased. This is because the students who do not have a noon lunchtime would not be included.</para></section>
<section id="eip-415"><title>Critical Evaluation</title><para id="element-607">We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include the following:</para><list id="element-17" list-type="bulleted"><item>Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not reliable. Reliability in statistical measures must also be considered when analyzing data. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure.  A measure is reliable when the same results are produced given the same circumstances.</item>
<item>Self-selected samplesResponses only by people who choose to respond, such as internet surveys, are often unreliable.</item>
<item>Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples include crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions.</item>
<item>Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response.</item>
<item>Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population.  Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.</item>
<item>Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.</item>
<item>Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.</item>

Suppose ABC high school has 10,000 upperclassman (junior and senior level) students (the population). We are interested in the average amount of money a upperclassmen spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 upperclassmen is an almost impossible task.</para>
<para id="element-199">Suppose we take two different samples. </para>
<para id="element-499">First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten upperclassman students from a first term organic chemistry class.

The second sample is a group of senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest.

<section id="eip-624"><title>Variation in Data</title><para id="id8219993"><term id="term-00008">Variation</term> is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:</para><para id="element-25004">15.8, 16.1, 15.2, 14.8, 15.8, 15.9, 16.0, 15.5.</para><para id="id6856137">Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.</para>
<para id="id5172174">Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.</para></section><section id="eip-735"><title>Variation in Samples</title><para id="id11414550">It was mentioned previously that two or more <term id="term-00009">samples</term> from the same <term id="term-00010">population</term>, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their high school sleep each night.  Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen's sample will be different from Jung's sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however. </para>

<para id="id10715475">If Doreen and Jung took larger samples, that is, the number of data values is increased, their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This is called <emphasis>sampling variability</emphasis>. In other words,  it refers to how much a statistic varies from sample to sample within a population. The larger the sample size, the smaller the variability between samples will be. So, the large sample size makes for a better, more reliable statistic.</para><section id="id-191351579127"><title>Size of a Sample</title><para id="id10291271">The size of a sample (often called the number of observations) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200–1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.</para><para id="eip-idp48192112">Be aware that many large samples are biased.

<para id="fs-idm39216544">Data are individual items of information that come from a population or sample. Data may be classified as qualitative (categorical), quantitative continuous, or quantitative discrete.</para>
<para id="eip-109">Because it is not practical to measure the entire population in a study, researchers use samples to represent the population. A random sample is a representative group from the population chosen by using a method that gives each individual in the population an equal chance of being included in the sample. Random sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Convenience sampling is a nonrandom method of choosing a sample that often produces biased
data.</para><para id="eip-396">Samples that contain different individuals result in different data. This is true even when the samples are well-chosen and representative of the population. When properly selected, larger samples model the population more closely than smaller samples. There are many different potential problems that can affect the reliability of a sample. Statistical data needs to be critically analyzed, not simply accepted.</para></section>

<para id="eip-265">Several online textbook retailers advertise that they have lower prices than on-campus bookstores. However, an important factor is whether the Internet retailers actually have the textbooks that students need in stock.  Students need to be able to get textbooks promptly at the beginning of the college term. If the book is not available, then a student would not be able to get the textbook at all, or might get a delayed delivery if the book is back ordered.</para>

<para id="eip-idm58143808"><newline/>A college newspaper reporter is investigating textbook availability at online retailers. He decides to investigate one textbook for each of the following seven subjects: calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, statistics, geology, and general engineering. He consults textbook industry sales data and selects the most popular nationally used textbook in each of these subjects. He visits websites for a random sample of major online textbook sellers and looks up each of these seven textbooks to see if they are available in stock for quick delivery through these retailers. Based on his investigation, he writes an article in which he draws conclusions about the overall availability of all college textbooks through online textbook retailers.<newline/></para>
<para id="eip-idm84454800">Write an analysis of his study that addresses the following issues: Is his sample representative of the population of all college textbooks?  Explain why or why not.  Describe some possible sources of bias in this study, and how it might affect the results of the study. Give some suggestions about what could be done to improve the study.</para>

</problem>
<solution id="eip-635">
<para id="eip-idp37500272">Answers will vary. Sample answer: The sample is not representative of the population of all college textbooks. Two reasons why it is not representative are that he only sampled seven subjects and he only investigated one textbook in each subject. There are several possible sources of bias in the study. The seven subjects that he investigated are all in mathematics and the sciences; there are many subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and other subject areas, for example: literature, art, history, psychology, sociology, business, that he did not investigate at all. It may be that different subject areas exhibit different patterns of textbook availability, but his sample would not detect such results.</para><para id="eip-idp37501360">He also looked only at the most popular textbook in each of the subjects he investigated. The availability of the most popular textbooks may differ from the availability of other textbooks in one of two ways:</para><list id="eip-id1168183078945"><item>The most popular textbooks may be more readily available online, because more new
copies are printed, and more students nationwide are selling back their used copies</item>
<item>The most popular textbooks may be harder to find available online, because more student demand exhausts the supply more quickly.</item>
</list><para id="eip-idm273136">In reality, many college students do not use the most popular textbook in their subject, and this study gives no useful information about the situation for those less popular textbooks.</para>
<para id="eip-idm272544">He could improve this study by</para><list id="eip-id1169691864822"><item>expanding the selection of subjects he investigates so that it is more representative of all subjects studied by college students, and</item>
<item>expanding the selection of textbooks he investigates within each subject to include a
mixed representation of both the most popular and less popular textbooks.</item>
